    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
    <p>
        My inspiration usually comes from moments; it may be sudden clarity at 3:00 AM, or when I am daydreaming. 
        This creativity has translated to my academic courses, which I have used to gain experience with each new projectâ€¦ 
        I want my work to be accepted and desired by the audience drawn to my work. I started to watch Japanese animation when I was in elementary school, 
        and it has inspired me to create animation and illustrations since.

        I would like to share my ideas and concepts with those who have similar interests.
         Fan art is one area I take particular interest in when I communicate with others using my art, especially by sharing fan art works on my social media. 
         I mainly use Procreate as it allow me to save my work anytime and anywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
        Recording my personal life and feelings is the main reason why I create artwork. 
        I want to record the moments in my life that I don't want to forget. 
        Though my interests may change and develop over time, I will be able to use my art to remember those important moments.
